Final Project - Finding Anomaly in video Analysis
Nowadays, there are many events which might happen in public fields, parks, malls, etc... and even private places such as banks, corporation buildings, etc...
Those tasks require security camera and a person to monitor them. If there are multiple cameras, its really hard to keep track on all of them and the person incharge might miss some events...
Thats what my team and I are trying to solve ! given a video, detect if there is any anomaly in it ! 
Anomaly types : Arson, Abuse, Assault, Explosion, Shoplifting, Vandalism and more...

we are using 3D CNN (3 Dimension Convolutional Network) to create a model that will predict if there is an anomaly in a given video,
and hopefully when we are done, this can be applied to live safety cameras !
